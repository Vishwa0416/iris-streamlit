# 🌸 Iris Species Prediction App (Streamlit + Machine Learning)

This project is a **Machine Learning web application** built using **Streamlit** that predicts the species of an Iris flower based on user-provided measurements.

The application demonstrates how a trained ML model can be quickly deployed as an **interactive web app using pure Python**, without any frontend frameworks.

## 📌 Why Streamlit?

Streamlit allows developers to:

Build ML applications using only Python

Rapidly prototype and deploy models

Create interactive dashboards with minimal effort

Focus on data and logic instead of frontend complexity

This project is a practical example of how Streamlit bridges the gap between Machine Learning models and real-world usability.
